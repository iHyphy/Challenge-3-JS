The reason for making this project was to create a random password generator which has 4 given criterias 
which you choose from and then will return a randomly generated password.

Have you ever had a problem with password security?
well this program will help you fix that problem by generating a random password that is incredibly hard to guess.

In this project we learned how to ask users for their criteria input and then take that and generate a random password
that fits in with the selected criteria, also if the criteria isnt selected at all it will generate an error to make sure 
that the user fits the requirements of the generator. 

I am honestly not sure what makes my project stand out as it is a simple password generator but you might find it useful.
